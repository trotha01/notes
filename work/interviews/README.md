# Interview Tips
Note that this page is inclined towards technical coding interviews

## Research the Company
You should definitely know about the company that you are interviewing for.
This includes what they do and what you will do there.
What the company does is not something you should ask during the interview,
that is something you should research beforehand if you don't know already.
What you will do there may be outlined in the position you applied for, but for this one, it's good to dig in and find out more details during the interview.

### Find out current events
I believe this is a giant plus in an interview.
Find out about current company events by going to the company twitter page, facebook group, or blog posts.
Find out by searching for news pages and articles.
Find out if the company is having any big releases coming up and just had some big releases.
It definitely helps to be able to bring up these topics during an interview.

## Always come with questions
At the end of every interview, the intervier usually asks if you have any questions.
You should always come prepared with questions.
You can have general questions that could apply to any company, such as:
- "What have you learned since starting here?" (To find out if it's a good environment for growth)
- "What are the main reasons you like working at <company_name>?"

You can have specific questions for the company as well.
This ties in to researching the company beforehand.
As you research into the company you are applying for,
be sure to write down questions as you think of them

## Practice Interview Questions
- Glassdoor.com
When applying for a company, you can look them up on glassdoor and see past interview questions that company has asked people.
Note that not all companies are on glassdoor, but many are.

- Cracking the Coding Interview
This is an awesome book with many practice interview questions and answers.

I would recomend finding a friend and working through practice interview questions.
If you can, have full practice interviews as well, so you're not as nervous for the real thing.
If you don't do well in an interview, just think of it as good practice for the next one.

## Don't be afraid to ask questions
Interviewers want to find someone they want to work with.
They will be looking for reasons to hire you, they are not looking for reasons to reject you.
They will be looking for someone that they want to work with each day, someone they would be okay sitting next to everyday.
Don't be afraid to ask questions and collaborate with the intervier throughout the interview.
If your stuck, it's better to ask for help, and get over that little bump, instead of losing half the interview thinking about a problem.

Use 'we' instead of 'I' when possible.

## That Awkward Silence
One thing that almost always seems to happen during an interview, is an awkward silence.
This happens when the interviewer asks a whiteboard programming question,
which you then proceed to go to the whiteboard and start figuring out how to solve the problem.
As you outline and write on the board, there is usually an empty silence in the room.

### How To Fix It
Make sure you think out loud, so the interviewer can follow your thought process,
and knows what's going on inside of your head.
This also helps the interviewer to know how you came to a certain solution.

## The resume
You can find that many people have many things to say about the resume.
There are many great articles and online resources for this topic, so I won't say too much here.
All I want to emphasize, is make it easy for recruiters to see your accomplishments,
and have many people read your resume and give you feedback.
If you're at a college, use the career department, colleges want their students to get jobs and be successful.
Whether colleges want it because of money or bragging rights, I can't say,
but they are usually willing to help with the resume either way.

## Stay Persistent
Everyone has to go through rejections.
It doesn't mean that you're not on the right career path, and it doesn't mean you should quit and stop looking.
All it means is that either that position at that company with those people is not the right fit for you at the time,
or that the interviewer was having a bad day. 

You can always re-apply to the company after 6 months to a year depending on the company.
You can try applying to a different team at that company.
Sometimes a company is in the middle of buckling down the first time you applied,
but later is open to bringing on many more people.
It's just the timing.

Make sure you keep applying to a variety of companies, you will have a hard time finding a position if you don't keep pushing.

## Connections
I don't know the statistics, but I believe more people get into companies through connections,
that cold online applications.
Reach out to your networks, and your networks networks. 

## Ask How It Went
After getting rejected from a company, don't be afraid to shoot the recruiter or intervier an email asking why.
Many companies won't tell you, but there is no downside in asking.
Many people don't do this, but you can gain some very valuable information.
I would estimate that the majority of the time, the reasons you didn't get into the company isn't for the reasons you think.

You don't have to explicitely say "Why didn't I get in",
instead you can word it more like:
- "I'm still interested in possible working as a <position> at <company name>, can I try re-applying in a year? If so what are some things I should work on before re-applying"
- "Hi <recrutier name>, I wanted to thank you for giving me the opportunity to apply for <company name>. I was curious to know what my pitfals are so I can improve on them."
- "Hi <recrutier name>, I wanted to thank you for giving me the opportunity to apply for <company name>. I was curious to know what I should work on, so I can improve in the future."

I'm not the best at wording these types of things, feel free to reword these. Or even better, make a pull request to help some other people out.
